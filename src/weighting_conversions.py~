'''
Converts various weightings between 0 and 100 to an actual amount to stress particular resource to
ALL UNITS IN BITS
All functions accept:
1.) Current allocation of resource
2.) Percentage to change resource. 
- A positive number means to increase the resource provisioning by a certain amount. 
- A negative numbers means to decrease the resource provisioning by a certain amount
Returns the new bandwdith
